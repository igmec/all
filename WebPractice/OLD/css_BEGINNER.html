====================== CSS BEGINNER ========================

- 3 ways to apply CSS
		1. Inline
			- go straight into HTML tags using the style attribute
			- <p style="color: red">Text</p>	makes this paragraph red
			- avoid using inline as much as possible


		2. Internal
			<style>
				p {
					color: red;
				}

				a {
					color: blue;	
				}
			</style>

			- style tag goes into <head> element
			- This particular style will change paragraphs to red and links to blue
			- Still avoid using this to keep HTML and CSS separate


		3. External
			- Will be everything between <style> tags in a separate style.css file
			- implement inside <head> element as such:
				<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">



	- Like HTML has tags, CSS has Selectors

	- selectors are names given to styles

	- selectors have properties inside curly braces

	- HTML selectors will change the HTML tags' properties



UNITS

	- px (such as font-size: 12px) is the unit for pixels.
	- em (such as font-size: 2em) is the unit for the calculated size of a font. So “2em”, for example, is two times the current font size.
	- pt (such as font-size: 12pt) is the unit for points, for measurements typically in printed media.
	- % (such as width: 80%) is the unit for… wait for it… percentages.

	- no unit needed for 0. {border: 0;}


COLORS

	- colours can be a name, RGB value or a hex code

	- RED
		- red
		- rgb(255,0,0)
		- rgb(100%, 0%, 0%)
		- #ff0000
		- #f00

	- Predefined colors: aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow

	- transparent is also a color value

	- CSS3 Allows HSL (hue saturation lightness) values

	- Colors applied with color tag and background-color tag

		h1{
			color: blue;
			background-color: yellow; 
		}


TEXT AND FONTS
	
	- stick to "safe" fonts (Arial, Verdana and Times New Roman)

	- to use a font:
		-font-family: arial, helvetica, serif, "Times New Roman"

	- font-size: 15px; 		to change the size of the font

	- font-weight states whether the text is bold or not. Most commonly this is used as font-weight: bold or font-weight: normal but other values are bolder, lighter, 100, 200, 300, 400 (same as normal), 500, 600, 700 (same as bold), 800 or 900.
		- Stick to font-weight: normal and font-weight: bold (older browsers)

	- font-style: normal  OR font-style: italic

	- text-decoration: underline, 		does what you would expect (keep to URLs)
	- text-decoration: overline 		places a line above the text.
	- text-decoration: line-through 	puts a line through the text (“strike-through”).
	- text-decoration: none 			to un-underline a link or text

	- text-transform: capitalize 		turns the first letter of every word into uppercase
	- text-transform: uppercase 		turns everything into uppercase
	- text-transform: lowercase 		turns everything into lowercase
	- text-transform: none 				no text transforms


	- letter-spacing
	- word-spacing
		- value is a length or "normal"

	- line-height - adjusts height of ines in element without changing font size
		- number (multiple of font), length, percent or "normal"

	- text-align
		- left, right, center or justify

	- text-indent - indents first line of paragraph to given length or %
		- used in print not in web



MARGINS AND PADDING

	- margin is the space OUTSIDE the element
		- margin
		- margin-top
		- margin-right
		- margin-bottom
		- margin-left
		
	- padding is the space INSIDE the element
		- padding
		- padding-top

		- padding-left



BORDERS

		- solid
		- dotted
		- dashed
		- double
		- groove
		- ridge
		- inset
		- outset
